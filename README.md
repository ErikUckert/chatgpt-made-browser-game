# chatgpt-made-browser-game
A little 2D browser game, made with the aid of chatGPT

# General concerns
I made this game with javascript and the help and suggestions of chat gpt.
I did not think of code by my self - I only asked chatGPT for desired features and how I would create them with javascript.

# State of the game
This game is currently PRE-ALPHA.
I work on it from time to time, mainly to the the capabilities of chatGPT for programming (& fun).

# How to run
Just visit [the games website](https://erikuckert.github.io/chatgpt-made-browser-game) or clone the repository to your local drive and open [game.html](index.html).
